# Unsupervised Multi-document summarization with graph clustering

Step 1: Fine tune a langauge model with "run_lm_finetuning.py".

Step 2: Text processing with "IE.py".

Step 3: Graph construction: To be done.

Step 4: Graph custering: To be done (Refer to https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/wang-mgae-2017/wang-mgae-2017.pdf) OR just use the spectural clustering algorithm.

Step 5: Sentence compression (title generation) within each cluster with "takahe.py".
